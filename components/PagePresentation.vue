                <br>
                These are my 3 most important values. These are what lead me to become who I am today.
                <br><br>
                I am an engineer because I love the process of making algorithms. Infinite ways to approach any problem freely.
                Watching it work better and better with each iteration, until the destination is reached,
                and that piece of code become a stone in the construction of a bigger structure.
                <br><br>
                I apply those programs to software development, robotics, 3D programming, and interface development.
                I have been building robots since I was a kid, for various tournaments or school projects, all the way to graduating as an embedded systems engineer.
                I have also developped many simulations, 3D applications, and interfaces.
                No matter the sector, I always find my way through that same core that is algorithmic problem-solving.
                <br><br>
                I am also an artist. I write, direct and produce animated short films and music videos.
                My works have garnered millions of views internationally, and been nominated to film festivals.
                This is something I do in my free time, that I love making and never get tired from.
                <br><br>
                Finally, I am an activist. As the founder of the <em>Walletvote</em> project,
                I am leading the development of a blockchain application to bring ethics and responsibility to the free market.
